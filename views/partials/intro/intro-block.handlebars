        Hi! I'm Foxy the Fixer!

    <p class="intro_1">
        I'm so glad you've made it to our quaint place designed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I hope you can see what a
        lovely town we have ...
    </p>
    <p class="intro_1">
        But every now and then these evildoers come and mess up our town by changing our HTML and CSS!
    </p>

    <p class="intro_1">
        Oh no Evil Doer Donald has come back and ruined our html and css that was used to design our town. Just look at
        the cracks in the building
    </p>

    <p class="intro_1">
        Can you help me restore the town back to the way it was?
    </p>
